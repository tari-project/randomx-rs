# randomx-rs
Rust bindings to the RandomX proof-of-work (Pow) system

## Build Dependencies

This repo makes use of git submodules.

The first time you compile, or perhaps after a big update after a `git pull`, you need to update the submodules:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If you see an error like
```
fatal: Needed a single revision
Unable to find current revision in submodule path 'RandomX'
```

you might want to see if there is a `RandomX` folder in the source tree. (On case insensitive systems, like OsX and Windows, it might
even be `randomx`). Deleting this folder and repeating the commands above should resolve the issue.

# Troubleshooting

## MacOs

If you're experiencing linker issues, or messages like

`cstdint:153:8: error: no member named 'int8_t' in the global namespace`

then you might have multiple conflicting versions of clang installed.

Try:
* Does `which cc` report more than one binary? If so, uninstalling one of the clang compilers might help.
* Upgrading cmake. `brew uninstall cmake && brew install cmake`
* `cargo clean`
